	* major API changes.  API has become simpler and is split into two
	  libraries. 
	* The Fuse.dll library communicates with the FUSE kernel module and
	  provides an API based on simple C# interfaces (Node, FileNode,
	  DirNode). 
	* The Sulf.dll library builds on Fuse.dll and provides a more natural
	  interface to C# objects (a Hashmap can be used as a directory, string
	  as a file, etc).  
	* Updated FuseWrapper and Fuse interfaces for FUSE 2.3 (Kernel api
	  version 6.1)

2005.01.15 Valient Gough
	* updated FuseWrapper and Fuse interfaces for FUSE 2.1 compatibility.

	  which is similar to libfuse's example/hello.c

2005.01.13 Valient Gough
	* release under LGPL license simplify build system to make it easier to
	  build add snapshot (see Downloads)
